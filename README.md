Area 51 has developed a user interactive website which shows the sun and the many spacecrafts orbiting around the sun. It solves the challenge by engaging users by retrieving posts from different social media platforms which users can interact with and also providing detailed information regarding each spacecraft. It is important as it provides awareness towards the users and help them understand more regarding these missions and how they have impacted our lives.
